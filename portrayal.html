After I finish tracking the demographics I was going to go through and track the confessional counts (talking head segments on the show) for each contestant as a way to see which groups tend to do the most narrating. I know there is a discrepency between genders with men receiving more confessionals, so it will be interesting to see what else arises. I may link an interview of a female contestant discussing why she felt she wasn't prominently shown on the show as well.
