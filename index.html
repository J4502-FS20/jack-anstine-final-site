Why I Chose This Topic

<p>
Survivor at its core is a show about 16-20 contestants being placed out in the elements where they must vote one another out to advance in the game. At the end, a jury of eliminated contestants votes one of the remaining competitors to win the title of "Sole Survivor", and the one million dollars that comes with it.
The show has lasted 20 years, 40 seasons and 596 episodes. At its height in August of 2000, ratings peaked at 51.69 million viewers for the season one finale. Today, Survivor consistently draws millions of viewers each episode.
Considering its popularity and role in mainstream culture, the representation and portrayal of different groups of people on the show carries some significance. Survivor is often referred to as a microcosm of our society, which leads me to wonder how often different members of our society can consistently find someone that they relate to on television. Additionally, I wonder how the representation on the show impacts the contestants' chance of winning. In an inherently social game are people more likely to graviate towards those they have something in common with, like ethnicity, sexuality or religion? Do these factors impact a contestants chances of winning the game? While there are too many factors to get conclusive answers to these questions, breaking down the statistics of those that have played Survivor could highlight some trends.
