<h1>
  50% of All CBS Reality TV Casts will be BIPOC
</h1>
</section>
<p>
A new CBS initiative was set in place on Nov. 9, requiring that all CBS reality TV programs casts are at least 50% Black, Indigenous or People of Color (BIPOC). This will increase the representation on the show, as around 30% of the casts on the past 10 seasons were BIPOC.
</p>

<P>
  The changes come after past Survivor contestants spoke out about how the lack of representation on the show puts the BIPOC castaways at a disadvantage. In June, 12 Black Survivor alumni discussed the set backs they experienced on the show. Some participants also spoke to the unfair portrayals they feel they received while on the show.

<P>
Following the concerns, CBS executives and Survivor producers met with past contestants to discuss the issue. After the new initiative was announced, several alumni involved in the conversation took to Twitter to celebrate.
