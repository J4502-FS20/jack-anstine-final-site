I haven't gotten to this step yet because the charting of the overall demographics has been time consuming, but I plan to show how many winners there are for different demographic groups. I also may discuss relevant specific examples, such as the first two-time winner being a Latinx female or the fact that there are a lot more male winners than female and the past six winners have all been male.
